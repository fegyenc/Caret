# Building an MSIX package

`Typedown.WinUI` builds unpackaged by default (`Debug`/`Debug_Local`, the configs used for day-to-day development) and packaged as MSIX only for `Release`, via the Windows App SDK's single-project packaging (`WindowsPackageType=MSIX` + `EnableMsixTooling`, `Package.appxmanifest`).

## Build the package

```ps
cd Caret\Dev\Typedown.WinUI
msbuild Typedown.WinUI.csproj -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -p:GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild=true
```

This produces a signed `.msix` under `bin\x64\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\AppPackages\Typedown.WinUI_<version>_x64_Test\`. (`<version>` is `Identity/Version` in `Package.appxmanifest`, for example `1.2.2.0`.)

`DebugType` is forced to `None` for Release: the packaging pipeline's symbol-package step shells out to a native VC++ tool (`mspdbcmf.exe`) that doesn't handle .NET 8's portable PDBs and fails the whole build outright rather than just skipping symbol packaging — not needed for an installable package, so no PDBs means nothing for that step to choke on.

## Signing

The repo ships wired up to sign with `Dev/Typedown.WinUI/CaretDevCert.pfx` — a **local, throwaway, self-signed** certificate (`CN=Caret`, matching `Package.appxmanifest`'s `Identity/Publisher`), gitignored, not something anyone else's clone will already have. Generate your own:

```ps
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -Subject "CN=Caret" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
  -FriendlyName "Caret Dev Signing Certificate" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
  -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3", "2.5.29.19={text}")
```

From there, either:

- **Sign via `PackageCertificateThumbprint`** (recommended for command-line builds): the cert above is already in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My`, so
  ```ps
  msbuild Typedown.WinUI.csproj -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -p:GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild=true `
    -p:PackageCertificateKeyFile= -p:PackageCertificateThumbprint=<thumbprint from $cert.Thumbprint>
  ```
  No password, no PFX file involved in the build itself.
- **Sign via `PackageCertificateKeyFile`** (what the csproj defaults to, `CaretDevCert.pfx`): export the cert to a password-protected PFX (`Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath CaretDevCert.pfx -Password $securePwd`) and pass `-p:PackageCertificatePassword=<password>` on the build command. A **password-less** PFX export (an empty `SecureString`) looks like it works but actually ties the file to the exact user/session that created it — importing it later from a different (even elevated) session fails with "requires either a different password or membership in an Active Directory principal." Use a real password if you go this route.

**If you regenerate the certificate for any reason** (new machine, fixing a password issue, whatever), the old `.msix` is signed with the *old* certificate's key pair — trusting the new certificate does nothing for a package that's already built. Rebuild after regenerating, or you'll hit `0x800B0109: The root certificate ... must be trusted` even with a certificate that looks right by name.

### Reminder: renew the GitHub signing certificate in mid-2027

The certificate that signs the GitHub releases (`CN=Caret`, thumbprint `F331F63C500CBCBC884B1F4045ABBAEA19D215ED`, the `Caret.cer` attached to every release) **expires on 2027-09-25**. The MSIX files are signed without a timestamp, so after that date Windows will no longer install a new release signed with it; copies already installed keep working. **Microsoft Store builds are not affected** (the Store signs them itself).

Start in **June 2027**, so there is time to test before the date:

1. Create a new self-signed certificate with the **same subject, `CN=Caret`** (the publisher in `Package.appxmanifest` must not change, or Windows sees a different app and installs side by side instead of updating), and give it a longer life (`-NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5)`). Same commands as above.
2. Rebuild and sign both packages with it, as in the release steps, and publish the new `Caret.cer` with the release.
3. **Before publishing, test on a PC that has the old build installed:** trust the new `Caret.cer`, then install the new package over it and check that it updates in place and keeps the settings. This is what has not been verified: whether Windows updates a package whose signing certificate changed but whose publisher name did not.
4. Say in the release notes that people who trust the old `Caret.cer` must trust the new one once (the steps are in the [1.2.1 release notes](https://github.com/fegyenc/Caret/releases/tag/v1.2.1#install)).
5. Worth deciding then: sign with a **timestamp** (`signtool sign /fd SHA256 /tr <timestamp server> /td SHA256`), so a package stays installable after its certificate expires.

The same reminder is open as a GitHub issue; close it when the new certificate is published.

**Bump `Package.appxmanifest`'s `Identity/Version` before rebuilding to reinstall over an existing install.** Confirmed the hard way: `Add-AppxPackage` refuses a package whose identity (name + version) matches an already-installed one but whose contents differ — `0x80073CFB`, "the provided package has the same identity as an already-installed package but the contents are different," even though the certificate trusted fine and everything else was correct. It's not a signing or trust problem, just AppX's own same-version-different-content guard. A same-version reinstall does work via `Remove-AppxPackage` first, but bumping the version is the normal path for "I rebuilt this with new code" — this project doesn't yet have anything that bumps it automatically, so it's a manual step each time you package a new build for local reinstall.

## Installing locally (sideload)

A self-signed certificate isn't trusted by Windows out of the box, so installing the package requires **trusting it first** — a machine-level security-store change, deliberately a manual step rather than something automated here. This needs a genuinely elevated PowerShell — Windows Terminal doesn't always show "Administrator" in the title bar the way classic `powershell.exe` does, so if in doubt, confirm with:

```ps
([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltinRole]::Administrator)
```

Then, as Administrator:

```ps
# Trust the certificate (PFX or CER both work with the matching cmdlet)
Import-PfxCertificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople -FilePath "CaretDevCert.pfx" -Password $securePwd
# or, from a public-only .cer (no password needed):
# Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople -FilePath "CaretDevCert.cer"

# Then install the package
Add-AppxPackage -Path "bin\x64\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\AppPackages\Typedown.WinUI_<version>_x64_Test\Typedown.WinUI_<version>_x64.msix"
```

Once installed, Caret appears in the Start menu with its own tile and can be uninstalled the normal Windows way (Settings → Apps, or right-click the Start tile).

## Troubleshooting: saves silently "work" but the file stays empty (0 bytes)

Symptom: File > Save (or Save As) shows no error, the Save dialog behaves normally, a file does appear on disk at the chosen path — but it's 0 bytes, the title bar keeps showing the unsaved-changes dot, and nothing in the app's log (`%TEMP%\caret_winui_probe.log`) records a completed save (no `Save: <path>` line, no exception either).

This is **Windows Defender's Controlled Folder Access** (ransomware protection) silently blocking the packaged app's write — not a bug in Caret. It only shows up for the *installed* package, not the dev build: Controlled Folder Access allowlists by exact executable path, and `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Caret_...\Typedown.WinUI.exe` is a path Windows has never seen before, while the dev build (`bin\...\Typedown.WinUI.exe`, run repeatedly all through development) had already been implicitly trusted. The `FileSavePicker` dialog itself still creates the empty target file, because that part runs through a trusted system broker process — it's specifically *Caret's own* write of the actual content that gets dropped.

**Confirm it's this** by checking Event Viewer's `Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational` log for event ID 1123 ("... has been blocked from modifying ... by Controlled Folder Access") around the time of the failed save, or from PowerShell:

```ps
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" -MaxEvents 50 |
  Where-Object Id -eq 1123 | Select-Object TimeCreated, Message -First 5
```

**Fix**: Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → "Manage ransomware protection" → "Allow an app through Controlled folder access" → Add an allowed app. Caret usually shows up directly under "Recently blocked apps"; otherwise browse to `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Caret_<version>_x64__<hash>\Typedown.WinUI.exe` (the exact hash suffix varies per install — `(Get-AppxPackage -Name Caret).InstallLocation` prints the real path). This is a security-setting change, so it's a manual step for whoever's installing the package, not something the build or install process can do on your behalf.

## Installing on another PC

The package + certificate travel as two files — copy both to the other machine (USB drive, a synced cloud folder, whatever's convenient):

- `Typedown.WinUI_<version>_x64.msix` — the app package itself
- `CaretDevCert.cer` — the **public** certificate only (export with `Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath CaretDevCert.cer`; never copy the `.pfx` anywhere for this — that's the private signing key, not needed on the install side and not something to hand out)

Then, on the other machine, as Administrator:

```ps
Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople -FilePath "CaretDevCert.cer"
Add-AppxPackage -Path "Typedown.WinUI_<version>_x64.msix"
```

Same trust-then-install shape as above, just with the plain `Import-Certificate` cmdlet since a `.cer` has no password to worry about. Every machine that will run this package needs this done once — that's the tradeoff of a self-signed dev certificate instead of a real code-signing certificate or a Store listing.

## Known gaps

- **x64 has been verified end-to-end** (build → sign → trust → install → launch). ARM64 packages are built for every release (and bundled with x64 for the Store) and checked (architecture in the manifest, both packages in the bundle), but they haven't been run on an ARM device here. x86 hasn't been packaged.
- **Caret is in the Microsoft Store** (Store ID `9N617SHLQM8G`, first published as 1.2.1, updated to 1.5.0.0). The Store package is built as described in [docs/store/README.md](docs/store/README.md): unsigned, with the Store identity, because the Store signs and certifies it, so Store installs need none of the self-signed-certificate trust steps above. This file's self-signed `.msix` is what the GitHub releases carry, for people who can't use the Store.
